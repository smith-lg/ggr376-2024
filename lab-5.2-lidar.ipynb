The LiDAR data are stored as 3-dimensional XYZ **arrays**, where data for each point are organised into three columns. X and Y represent the horizontal position (east-west and north-south positions), while Z represents the height (elevation) of the point above the Earth's surface.\n",

    "We will also use the **numpy** library which is particularly helpful when working with array data structures.
