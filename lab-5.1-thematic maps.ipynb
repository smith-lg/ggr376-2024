    "In week 11 we discussed the importance of EDA for providing insights into data. Python and Jupyter notebooks provide an excellent tool for EDA, allowing the analyst to i) manipulate and visualize data comprehensively and ii) systematically document their workflow for other specialists to replicate. This capability empowers analysts to understand data structure and uncover patterns and outliers effectively. Such insights are valuable for informing decision-making around future analyses and visualization.\n",

We will use the [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide.html) library which is an extension of the data processing library, **pandas**, that allows us to work with spatial data. Data are stored as a **GeoDataFrame**: a tabular structure with a geometry field containing information aboout geometry type (e.g., point, line, or polygon) and location (e.g., coordinates).\n",
